## Screenshot Naming Convention

All screenshots must follow this standardized naming pattern:

```
Project_Pt_X_Screenshot_Y_Descriptive_Name.png
```

Where:
- **X** = Part number (1-4)
- **Y** = Screenshot number within that part (sequential)
- **Descriptive_Name** = Brief description of what the screenshot shows

**Examples**: `Project_Pt_1_Screenshot_1_Structured_JSON_Logging.png`, `Project_Pt_2_Screenshot_3_XRay_Trace_Analysis.png`

## Tips for Success

- **Take screenshots as you work** - Don't wait until the end to capture evidence
- **Include timestamps** - Ensure timestamps are visible in before/after comparisons
- **Annotate where helpful** - Circle or highlight key elements in screenshots
- **Be specific in analysis files** - Include exact values, not vague descriptions
- **Test your fixes** - Ensure improvements are measurable before taking final screenshots
- **Use descriptive filenames** - The screenshot name should tell the reviewer what to expect
